# GenericSHSsolver
This MATLAB script is designed for generating closed-form expressions for average age based on an AoI SHS model.

It is designed based on analytical approach proposed in [1].

It includes the SHS models for LCFS-S, LCFS-W, LCFS-Preemptive, LCFS-Nonpreemptive with exponential and Erlang service distributions.
